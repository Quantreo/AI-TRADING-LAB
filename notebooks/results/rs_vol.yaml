  comment: Demonstration of how Quantreo structures empirical relations between features
    and predictive targets before interpretation by the DSR agent.
  generated_with: Quantreo educational pipeline (simplified demo)
  note: The real implementation includes rolling robustness tests, cross-asset validation,
    and automatic feature ranking.

alpha_concept:
  name: Low-Volatility Trend Persistence
  hypothesis: Assets with high realized volatility over a 100-period horizon exhibit
    reduced trend persistence.
  expected_role: filter
  target_behavior: mean_reversion
  related_features:
  - rs_vol_50
  - log_vol_60
  - tail_vol_50
  - rs_vol_120
  lbp:
    who_loses: Market participants who fail to adapt to changes in volatility, holding
      onto low-volatility assets during periods of high realized volatility.
    behavioral_bias: Anchoring bias, where market participants over-rely on past performance
      and fail to adjust to changing market conditions.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of this inefficiency is due to the time it
      takes for market participants to recognize and adapt to changes in volatility,
      as well as the complexity and latency of market information.

    who_loses: Market participants who fail to account for cross-asset volatility
      relationships, such as traders focusing on a single asset's volatility.
    behavioral_bias: Anchoring bias, where market participants rely too heavily on
      their own asset's volatility, neglecting the impact of other assets.
    persistence_reason: Latency and liquidity differences between assets, as well
      as structural differences in market microstructure, contribute to the persistence
      of cross-asset volatility relationships.

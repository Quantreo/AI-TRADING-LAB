alpha_concept:
  name: Regime-Dependent Volatility Trend
  hypothesis: The target captures the relationship between future realized volatility,
    historical volatility trends, and market conditions, exhibiting regime-dependent
    behavior.
  expected_role: filter
  target_behavior: trend
  related_features:
  - rs_vol_50
  - log_vol_60
  - tail_vol_50
  lbp:
    who_loses: Market makers and high-frequency traders who rely on volatility predictions
      may lose due to the target's regime-dependent behavior.
    behavioral_bias: The biased perception of volatility trends by investors and traders
      may contribute to the inefficiency.
    persistence_reason: The differences in correlation strength between low and high
      volatility regimes, as well as the limited robustness across feature families,
      may contribute to the persistence of this inefficiency.

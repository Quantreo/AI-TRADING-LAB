alpha_concept:
  name: Trend Following Volatility
  hypothesis: The alpha tries to capture the relationship between trend and volatility
  expected_role: signal
  target_behavior: trend
  related_features:
  - returns_100
  - linear_slope_100
  - entropy_returns_100
  - tail_returns_200
  - z_score_returns_50
  - log_vol_50
  lbp:
    who_loses: Trend followers who are long positions in assets with decreasing trend
      and increasing volatility are structurally on the losing side.
    behavioral_bias: The bias of trend followers to increase their position size as
      the trend continues, without adjusting for increasing volatility, maintains
      this inefficiency.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of this inefficiency is due to the latency
      in adjusting position sizes to changes in volatility, allowing trend followers
      to continue losing as the trend eventually reverses.
alpha_formula:
  name: Trend Following Volatility
  formula: -1 * (linear_slope_100 * log_vol_50)
  conditioning: linear_slope_100 < 0 and log_vol_50 > sma(log_vol_50, 20)

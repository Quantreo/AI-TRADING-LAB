alpha_concept:
  name: Trend Persistence Alpha
  hypothesis: The alpha captures the persistence of trends in asset returns, exploiting
    structural inefficiencies in market participants' expectations and behaviors.

  lbp:
    who_loses: Institutional investors and high-frequency traders who rely on short-term
      trend-following strategies are structurally on the losing side, as they fail
      to capture the persistence of trends in asset returns.
    behavioral_bias: Market participants' tendency to overreact to short-term price
      movements and underreact to long-term trends creates a behavioral bias that
      maintains this inefficiency.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of trends is due to the limitations of human
      perception and processing capacity, which lead to delayed reactions to changing
      market conditions and an inability to accurately assess the strength of trends.
      Additionally, the structure of financial markets, including latency and liquidity
      constraints, exacerbates this persistence.

  name: Volatility Exit Signal
  hypothesis: Market participants who are structurally on the losing side are those
    who fail to accurately price volatility, resulting in misallocated capital and
    inefficient market outcomes.
  expected_role: exit_signal
  target_behavior: trend following, mean reversion, volatility clustering

    who_loses: Market participants who are structurally on the losing side are those
      who fail to accurately price volatility, resulting in misallocated capital and
      inefficient market outcomes.
    behavioral_bias: The behavioral bias that maintains this inefficiency is the tendency
      of investors to overreact to changes in volatility, leading to excessive buying
      or selling of assets.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of this inefficiency is due to the complexity
      of volatility pricing and the limitations of investors' ability to accurately
      assess risk, as well as the structural characteristics of the market, such as
      liquidity and latency.

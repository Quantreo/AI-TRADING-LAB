  name: Volatility Persistence Signal

  lbp:
    who_loses: Active traders and market makers who frequently enter and exit positions
      in volatile assets may experience increased trading costs and reduced profitability.
    behavioral_bias: The desire for quick profits and failure to account for volatility
      persistence may lead traders to overestimate their ability to manage risk and
      underestimate the associated costs.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of realized volatility is influenced by market
      structure and the availability of liquidity, which can make it difficult for
      traders to accurately predict and manage volatility.

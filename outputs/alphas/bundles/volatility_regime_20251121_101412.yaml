alpha_concept:
  name: Volatility Regime
  hypothesis: The alpha aims to capture differences in volatility behavior across
    regimes, exploiting structural inefficiencies in market participants' expectations.
  expected_role: regime_indicator

  lbp:
    who_loses: Institutional investors and high-frequency traders who rely on mean-reversion
      strategies, often exacerbating price movements during high volatility periods.
    behavioral_bias: Confirmation bias, where market participants overreact to recent
      price movements, maintaining the volatility regime.
    persistence_reason: Liquidity and market structure, as reduced liquidity during
      high volatility periods leads to increased price movements and amplifies existing
      regime behaviors.

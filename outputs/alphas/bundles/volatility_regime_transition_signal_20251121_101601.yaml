  name: Volatility Regime Transition Signal
  hypothesis: The alpha concept aims to capture the transition from a low to high
    volatility regime, exploiting the structural differences in relationships between
    volatility metrics and market factors.

  lbp:
    who_loses: Market participants with a bias towards investing in assets with high
      volatility, who are more likely to experience significant losses during a regime
      transition.
    behavioral_bias: Herd behavior and momentum investing, which can exacerbate the
      transition between low and high volatility regimes.
    persistence_reason: The regime-dependent relationships between volatility metrics
      and market factors, which are influenced by structural differences in asset
      characteristics, investor behavior, and market conditions.

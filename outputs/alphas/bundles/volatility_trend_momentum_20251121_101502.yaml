alpha_concept:
  name: Volatility Trend Momentum
  hypothesis: Capturing the relationship between historical volatility features and
    future realized volatility, indicating a trend momentum signal.
  expected_role: signal
  target_behavior: mean_reversion
  related_features:
  - rs_vol_50
  - log_vol_60
  - tail_vol_50
  - rs_vol_120
  - log_vol_50
  lbp:
    who_loses: Market participants who fail to recognize changes in historical volatility
      features, leading to underestimation of future realized volatility.
    behavioral_bias: The bias of underestimating future volatility due to the availability
      heuristic, where market participants overestimate the importance of recent events.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of this inefficiency is due to the latency
      in recognizing changes in historical volatility features, as well as the liquidity
      constraints in adjusting portfolio positions.
alpha_formula:
  name: Volatility Trend Momentum
  formula: rank(rs_vol_50) * (log_vol_60 - log_vol_50)
  conditioning: rs_vol_50 > rs_vol_120

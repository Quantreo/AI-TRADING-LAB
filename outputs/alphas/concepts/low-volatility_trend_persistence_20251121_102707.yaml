  lbp:
    who_loses: Market participants who fail to adapt to changes in volatility, holding
      onto low-volatility assets during periods of high realized volatility.
    behavioral_bias: Anchoring bias, where market participants over-rely on past performance
      and fail to adjust to changing market conditions.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of this inefficiency is due to the time it
      takes for market participants to recognize and adapt to changes in volatility,
      as well as the complexity and latency of market information.

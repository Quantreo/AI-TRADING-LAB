    who_loses: Market participants who fail to adapt to changes in volatility regimes,
      potentially including trend followers and those relying on historical volatility
      metrics.
    behavioral_bias: Confirmation bias and inadequate consideration of regime-dependent
      relationships, leading to suboptimal trading decisions.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of volatility regimes is driven by structural
      factors, such as differences in market participation, liquidity, and risk appetite,
      which can lead to regime-dependent behavior in volatility metrics.

  lbp:
    who_loses: Trend followers who are long positions in assets with decreasing trend
      and increasing volatility are structurally on the losing side.
    behavioral_bias: The bias of trend followers to increase their position size as
      the trend continues, without adjusting for increasing volatility, maintains
      this inefficiency.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of this inefficiency is due to the latency
      in adjusting position sizes to changes in volatility, allowing trend followers
      to continue losing as the trend eventually reverses.

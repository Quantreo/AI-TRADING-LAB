    who_loses: High-frequency traders and market makers are structurally on the losing
      side due to their reliance on short-term price movements and order book dynamics.
    behavioral_bias: The bias of market participants to focus on short-term price
      movements and volatility metrics leads to a neglect of long-term regime shifts,
      resulting in inefficient price discovery.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of volatility regimes is due to the structural
      characteristics of market participants, the dominance of high-frequency trading,
      and the limitations of liquidity and order book dynamics.

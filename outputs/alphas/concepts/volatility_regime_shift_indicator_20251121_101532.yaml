alpha_concept:
  name: Volatility Regime Shift Indicator
  hypothesis: The alpha tries to capture the regime shift in volatility, identifying
    when the market transitions from a low to a high volatility regime.
  expected_role: signal
  target_behavior: mean_reversion

  - rs_vol_50

  lbp:
    who_loses: Market participants who are long volatility, such as those with high
      exposure to tail-risk assets, tend to lose during the regime shift.
    behavioral_bias: The bias of market participants to extrapolate recent trends
      and ignore regime shifts contributes to the inefficiency.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of the regime shift is due to the structure
      of the market, where high volatility regimes tend to persist for longer periods,
      and the latency of market participants to adjust their positions.

alpha_concept:
  name: Volatility Regime Shift Signal
  hypothesis: The alpha captures the regime shift from low to high volatility, allowing
    for timely adjustments in trading strategies.
  expected_role: signal
  target_behavior: mean_reversion, volatility
  related_features:
  - rs_vol_50
  - log_vol_60
  - tail_vol_50
  - rs_vol_120
  lbp:
    who_loses: Market makers and institutional investors who rely on mean reversion
      strategies may be structurally on the losing side, as the regime shift signal
      can help traders anticipate and adapt to changes in volatility.
    behavioral_bias: The bias of anchoring and overconfidence may maintain the inefficiency,
      as traders tend to rely on recent patterns and fail to adjust to changes in
      market conditions.
    persistence_reason: The regime-dependent relationships between volatility features
      and the target may persist due to differences in market structure, liquidity,
      and regulation across regimes.

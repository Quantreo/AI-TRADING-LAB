      volatility, who are more likely to experience significant losses during a regime
      transition.
    behavioral_bias: Herd behavior and momentum investing, which can exacerbate the
      transition between low and high volatility regimes.
    persistence_reason: The regime-dependent relationships between volatility metrics
      and market factors, which are influenced by structural differences in asset
      characteristics, investor behavior, and market conditions.

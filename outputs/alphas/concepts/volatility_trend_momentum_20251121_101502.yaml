    who_loses: Market participants who fail to recognize changes in historical volatility
      features, leading to underestimation of future realized volatility.
    behavioral_bias: The bias of underestimating future volatility due to the availability
      heuristic, where market participants overestimate the importance of recent events.
    persistence_reason: The persistence of this inefficiency is due to the latency
      in recognizing changes in historical volatility features, as well as the liquidity
      constraints in adjusting portfolio positions.

dsr_observation:
  definition: The target measures the Hurst exponent over a 100-period horizon, reacting
    to long-range dependence in price movements.
  stability: The relationship between the target and its related features remains
    consistent across assets, with correlation means ranging from 0.41 to 0.45 and
    standard deviations between 0.07 and 0.09. The number of crossings over a 1000
    observation window is low, with a maximum of 2.
  robustness: The relationships exhibit moderate robustness across assets, with correlation
    strength and mutual information means showing limited dispersion. The difference
    between correlation and mutual information families (hurst_100 vs log_kurt_100)
    indicates limited robustness.
  overall_assessment: moderate
  comment: The target's relationships with volatility features are consistent but
    show limited robustness due to differences in correlation and mutual information
    families.

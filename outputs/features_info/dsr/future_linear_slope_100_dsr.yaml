dsr_observation:
  definition: The target measures the linear slope of returns over a 100-period horizon,
    reacting to changes in the trend of the underlying asset.
  stability: The relationships with its related features remain consistent across
    assets, with mean correlations ranging from 0.6 to 0.2 and standard deviations
    between 0.04 and 0.18. The number of crossings over a 1000 observation window
    ranges from 0 to 2, indicating moderate stability.
  robustness: The relationships are generalizable across assets, with correlation
    strength and mutual information metrics showing similar patterns across different
    assets. However, the dispersion of these metrics across horizons is not provided,
    limiting the assessment of robustness. The mean mutual information with tail_returns_200
    ranges from 0.46 to 0.5, indicating a structurally robust relationship.
  overall_assessment: moderate
  comment: The target exhibits moderate stability and robustness, with consistent
    relationships across assets, but limited information on horizon dispersion.

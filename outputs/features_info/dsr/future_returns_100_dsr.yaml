dsr_observation:
  definition: The target measures the relationship between future returns over a 100-period
    horizon and related features, including returns, linear slope, and entropy of
    returns.
  stability: The relationships with its related features remain consistent across
    assets, with correlation means ranging from 0.5 to 0.55 and standard deviations
    between 0.05 and 0.07. The number of crossings over a 1000 observation window
    is generally low, with most assets having 1 crossing.
  robustness: The relationships are generalizable across assets, with correlation
    strength and mutual information means showing low dispersion across assets (e.g.,
    correlation means range from 0.5 to 0.55, and mutual information means range from
    0.38 to 0.42). The similarity between correlation and mutual information families
    (both related to returns) suggests structurally robust relationships.
  overall_assessment: moderate
  comment: The target exhibits moderate stability and robustness, with consistent
    relationships across assets and low dispersion in correlation and mutual information
    metrics.

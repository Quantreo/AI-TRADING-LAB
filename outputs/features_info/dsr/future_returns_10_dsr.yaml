dsr_observation:
  definition: The target measures the relationship between future returns over a 10-period
    horizon and its related features, including returns, absolute returns, and tail
    returns.
  stability: The relationships with its related features remain consistent across
    assets, with correlation means ranging from 0.36 to 0.42 and standard deviations
    between 0.07 and 0.1. The number of crossings over a 1000 observation window is
    generally low, with most assets having 1 or 2 crossings.
  robustness: The relationships are generalizable across assets, with correlation
    strength and mutual information means showing limited dispersion across assets
    (e.g., correlation means for returns_10 range from 0.36 to 0.42). However, the
    difference between correlation and mutual information families (e.g., returns_10
    vs tail_returns_50) indicates limited robustness.
  overall_assessment: moderate
  comment: The target exhibits moderate stability and robustness, with consistent
    relationships across assets but limited generalizability across different feature
    families.

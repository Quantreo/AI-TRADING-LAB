dsr_observation:
  definition: The target measures the future realized volatility over a 100-period
    horizon, reacting to changes in historical volatility features such as rs_vol_50,
    log_vol_60, and tail_vol_50.
  stability: The relationships with its related features remain consistent across
    assets in the low volatility regime, with mean correlation values ranging from
    0.68 to 0.74 for rs_vol_50 and standard deviations between 0.03 and 0.05. In contrast,
    the high volatility regime exhibits lower mean correlation values (0.3-0.36 for
    rs_vol_50) and higher standard deviations (0.14-0.17), with 1-2 crossings observed
    across assets.
  robustness: The relationships are generalizable across assets, with correlation
    strength and mutual information values showing consistent patterns. For example,
    the mean mutual information values for rs_vol_120 range from 0.49 to 0.53 across
    assets in the low volatility regime, indicating a structurally robust relationship.
    However, the differences in mean values between low and high volatility regimes
    are significant, suggesting regime-dependent relationships.
  overall_assessment: moderate
  comment: The target exhibits stable and robust relationships with volatility features
    in the low volatility regime, but shows regime-dependent behavior with reduced
    correlation strength in the high volatility regime.

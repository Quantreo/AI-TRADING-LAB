dsr_observation:
  definition: The target measures the future realized volatility over a 120-period
    horizon, reacting to changes in various volatility metrics across different assets.
  stability: The relationships between the target and its related features remain
    consistent across low and high volatility regimes, with mean correlations ranging
    from 0.15 to 0.69 and standard deviations between 0.03 and 0.17. The number of
    crossings over a 1000 observation window is generally low, with most features
    exhibiting 0 to 2 crossings.
  robustness: The relationships exhibit moderate robustness across assets, with correlation
    strengths and mutual information values varying across different assets and horizons.
    For example, the mean correlation with oil_vol_50 ranges from 0.17 to 0.60, while
    the mean mutual information with gold_vol_50 ranges from 0.14 to 0.42. Dispersion
    in correlation and mutual information values across assets and regimes is moderate,
    with standard deviations between 0.03 and 0.11.
  overall_assessment: moderate
  comment: The target's relationships with related features are moderately robust
    and stable, with consistent correlations and mutual information values across
    regimes and assets.

dsr_observation:
  definition: The target measures the future realized volatility over a 50-period
    horizon, reacting to changes in historical volatility and tail risk.
  stability: The relationships with rs_vol_50 remain consistent across assets, with
    mean correlations ranging from 0.58 to 0.63 and low standard deviations (0.06-0.09),
    and few crossings (0-1) over the observation window.
  robustness: The relationships exhibit moderate robustness across assets, with correlation
    strength varying by 0.05 (0.58-0.63) and mutual information with tail_vol_50 showing
    consistent means (0.44-0.48) and low standard deviations (0.05-0.07).
  overall_assessment: moderate
  comment: The target's relationship with volatility features is consistent, but robustness
    across assets and horizons could be further evaluated.

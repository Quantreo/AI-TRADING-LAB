- session_volume_share
dsr_observation:
  definition: The target measures the average proportion of total daily volume captured
    by each session, normalized so that asia + nyc + london = 1.0 for each asset.
  stability: The relationships with session_volume_share remain consistent across
    different assets (6E, 6B, 6J, 6A, 6C) with means ranging from 0.18 to 0.32 and
    standard deviations between 0.03 and 0.05.
  robustness: The relationships are generalizable across assets, with a dispersion
    of means (0.18-0.32) and standard deviations (0.03-0.05) indicating moderate robustness.
  overall_assessment: moderate
  comment: The target exhibits moderate stability and robustness in measuring session
    volume proportions across different assets.

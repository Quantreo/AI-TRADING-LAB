alpha_concept:
  name: Multi-Horizon Momentum Continuation
  hypothesis: "Assets that have shown recent positive (or negative) returns over 10\u2011\
    \ to 100\u2011period windows, especially when accompanied by a rising linear slope\
    \ and low return entropy, tend to keep moving in the same direction in the near\
    \ future."

  lbp:
    who_loses: "Late\u2011entering trend followers and early\u2011acting contrarians\
      \ who bet on a reversal lose as the price continues its established direction."
    behavioral_bias: "Herding and underreaction \u2013 market participants collectively\
      \ reinforce recent price moves while individually underestimating the persistence\
      \ of the trend."
    persistence_reason: Execution latency, transaction costs, and limited capacity
      for rapid arbitrage prevent immediate correction, allowing the momentum effect
      to persist across assets and horizons.

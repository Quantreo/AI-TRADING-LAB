  name: "Multi\u2011Horizon Momentum Persistence"
  hypothesis: "Positive past returns and upward linear slopes over 10\u2011 to 100\u2011\
    period windows forecast continued price appreciation, indicating that trend\u2011\
    following pressure outweighs mean\u2011reversion forces across assets."

  lbp:
    who_loses: "Contrarian and value\u2011based participants who repeatedly trade\
      \ against the prevailing price drift, absorbing the cost of price reversals."
    behavioral_bias: Herding and anchoring on recent price moves cause market participants
      to reinforce the existing trend rather than correct it promptly.
    persistence_reason: "Slow diffusion of fundamental information, limited arbitrage\
      \ capacity, and the mechanical impact of systematic trend\u2011following funds\
      \ create a self\u2011reinforcing momentum that endures across multiple horizons."

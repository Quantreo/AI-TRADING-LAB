alpha_concept:
  name: "Multi\u2011Horizon Return\u2011Slope Momentum"
  hypothesis: "When recent returns are positive and the linear slope of returns over\
    \ medium horizons (\u2248100 periods) is also positive, the asset exhibits a persistent\
    \ upward drift that carries into the next 10\u2011100 periods, especially in the\
    \ presence of low entropy (ordered price paths) and modest tail risk."

  lbp:
    who_loses: "Late\u2011entering momentum traders and high\u2011frequency arbitrageurs\
      \ who must chase an already established price move, incurring adverse fill prices."
    behavioral_bias: Investor underreaction and anchoring to recent price levels cause
      the market to adjust price gradually rather than instantly.
    persistence_reason: "Information diffusion and order\u2011flow inertia in institutional\
      \ portfolios, combined with regulatory constraints on rapid position scaling,\
      \ sustain the lagged price adjustment."

alpha_concept:
  name: "Cross\u2011Asset Volatility Spillover Signal"
  hypothesis: "In periods when short\u2011term volatility in major commodities (oil,\
    \ gold, bitcoin) and the USD factor rise, the realized volatility of broader equity\
    \ markets (e.g., S&P\u202F500) over the next 60\u2011120 periods also rises, reflecting\
    \ a contagion of risk perception across asset classes."

  lbp:
    who_loses: "Leveraged and risk\u2011seeking investors who are on the long side\
      \ of equities when volatility spikes, as higher volatility erodes risk\u2011\
      adjusted returns and raises margin calls."
    behavioral_bias: "Overreaction to commodity\u2011driven news and anchoring to\
      \ recent volatility bursts, causing herd\u2011like widening of risk premia across\
      \ markets."
    persistence_reason: Structural linkages between commodity pricing, funding costs,
      and equity market liquidity create a lagged transmission channel; regulatory
      capital buffers and margin timing further delay the adjustment, allowing the
      spillover effect to persist.

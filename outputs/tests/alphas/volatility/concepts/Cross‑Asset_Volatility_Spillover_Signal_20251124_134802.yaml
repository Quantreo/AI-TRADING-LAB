alpha_concept:
  name: "Cross\u2011Asset Volatility Spillover Signal"
  hypothesis: "In periods of elevated market stress, realized volatility in major\
    \ risk assets (equities, commodities, crypto) transmits to other instruments,\
    \ creating a predictable upward drift in future realized volatility of the target\
    \ horizon. This spillover is driven by coordinated risk\u2011off behavior and\
    \ hedging flows that amplify volatility across markets."

    who_loses: "Short\u2011volatility option writers and high\u2011frequency market\
      \ makers who are on the adverse side of sudden volatility spikes."
    behavioral_bias: "Overconfidence and anchoring cause participants to underestimate\
      \ the speed and magnitude of cross\u2011asset volatility contagion, while herding\
      \ reinforces collective risk\u2011off moves."
    persistence_reason: "Capital\u2011intensive hedging mandates, regulatory liquidity\
      \ buffers, and latency in information diffusion across asset classes sustain\
      \ the spillover effect, making it observable over 50\u2011120 period horizons."

  name: cross_asset_volatility_persistence_signal
  hypothesis: "Recent realized volatility and tail\u2011risk measures in the equity,\
    \ commodity and crypto markets, together with a high Hurst exponent (indicating\
    \ long\u2011range dependence), forecast elevated future realized volatility over\
    \ 50\u2011120\u2011period horizons. The effect is stronger in low\u2011volatility\
    \ regimes where volatility persistence is more pronounced."

  lbp:
    who_loses: "market participants who are short volatility\u2014option writers,\
      \ volatility\u2011selling strategies, and leveraged long\u2011volatility funds\u2014\
      experience larger losses when volatility persists or spikes."
    behavioral_bias: "anchoring to recent low\u2011volatility periods and underestimation\
      \ of tail\u2011risk events cause systematic underpricing of future volatility."
    persistence_reason: "limited hedging capacity for extreme tail events, regulatory\
      \ capital constraints on volatility exposure, and cross\u2011asset information\
      \ diffusion delays create a structural lag that sustains the predictive relationship."

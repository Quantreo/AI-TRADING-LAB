alpha_concept:
  name: Volatility Regime Divergence Indicator
  hypothesis: "When short\u2011term realized volatility (e.g., rs_vol_50, log_vol_50)\
    \ diverges upward from longer\u2011term volatility benchmarks (e.g., rs_vol_120,\
    \ log_vol_60, sp500_vol_100), the market transitions into a high\u2011volatility\
    \ regime characterized by heightened tail risk and reduced correlation stability."
  expected_role: regime_indicator
  target_behavior: volatility

  pcp:
    who_loses: "Market makers, high\u2011frequency liquidity providers, and leveraged\
      \ long/short positions that rely on stable spreads and low\u2011volatility assumptions."
    behavioral_bias: "Overconfidence and anchoring to recent low\u2011volatility periods\
      \ cause participants to underestimate the probability of abrupt volatility spikes."
    persistence_reason: "Capital\u2011intensive market\u2011making and regulatory\
      \ liquidity buffers adjust slowly, while order\u2011flow clustering around news\
      \ events creates persistent periods of volatility amplification."

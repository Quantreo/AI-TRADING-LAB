alpha_concept:
  name: Volatility Regime Shift Indicator
  hypothesis: "When short\u2011term realized volatility (e.g., rs_vol_50) decouples\
    \ from longer\u2011term volatility (e.g., rs_vol_120) and tail\u2011risk measures\
    \ (tail_vol_50, tail_returns_100) spike, the market transitions into a high\u2011\
    volatility regime characterized by amplified price swings and reduced liquidity."
  expected_role: regime_indicator
  target_behavior: volatility

  pcp:
    who_loses: "Market makers and leveraged long\u2011short funds that rely on stable\
      \ spreads; they are forced to widen quotes or unwind positions when volatility\
      \ spikes."
    behavioral_bias: "Overconfidence and anchoring to recent low\u2011volatility periods\
      \ cause participants to underestimate tail risk, delaying protective actions\
      \ until volatility surges."
    persistence_reason: "Risk\u2011limit frameworks, capital\u2011charge regulations,\
      \ and latency in updating risk models keep the lag between short\u2011term volatility\
      \ spikes and market\u2011wide risk reallocation, allowing the regime to persist."

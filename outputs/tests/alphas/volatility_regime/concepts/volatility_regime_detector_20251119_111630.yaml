    who_loses: Noise traders and trend followers who fail to adapt to changing volatility
      regimes.
    behavioral_bias: Overconfidence and anchoring biases lead to underestimation or
      overestimation of volatility, causing traders to make suboptimal decisions.
    persistence_reason: Market structure, latency, and regulatory constraints contribute
      to the persistence of volatility regimes, allowing for predictable patterns
      to emerge.
